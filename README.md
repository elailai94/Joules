### About
Joules is a library (gem) for providing simple Physics formulas in kinematics, forces, waves, electricity, and so much more. A selection of fundamental constants are also provided. It is written entirely in Ruby.

### Library Installation
```Bash
gem install joules-0.0.3.gem
```

### Library Import
```Ruby
require 'joules'
```
